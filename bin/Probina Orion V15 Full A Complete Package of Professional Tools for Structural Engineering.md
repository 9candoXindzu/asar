Then, you can use the graphical user interface to draw the plan of the building. You can also import the plan from a CAD file or an image file. You can define the grid lines, columns, beams, slabs and walls using the drawing tools. You can also assign the material properties, section properties and load cases to the elements using the property windows. Probina Orion V15 Full allows you to create complex models with ease and accuracy.
 
## Analyzing the Building
 
The next step is to analyze the building using the powerful analysis engine of Probina Orion V15 Full. You can choose from various analysis options such as linear or nonlinear static analysis, modal analysis, response spectrum analysis or time history analysis. You can also define the seismic parameters such as soil type, site class and response spectrum according to the code. Probina Orion V15 Full can handle large and complex models with speed and accuracy.
 
## Designing the Building
 
The third step is to design the building using the comprehensive design module of Probina Orion V15 Full. You can perform code-checking and optimization for various international codes and standards such as ACI 318, BS 8110, Eurocode 2 or IS 456. You can also customize the design parameters such as reinforcement ratios, cover depths and bar sizes according to your preferences and needs. Probina Orion V15 Full can provide you with optimal and economical design solutions for your projects.
 
## Detailing the Building
 
The final step is to detail the building using the advanced detailing module of Probina Orion V15 Full. You can generate detailed drawings, schedules and reports automatically from the analysis and design results. You can also edit and modify the drawings using the editing tools. You can export the drawings to various formats such as DWG, DXF or PDF. You can also print or plot the drawings using the printing options. Probina Orion V15 Full can produce high-quality and professional drawings for your projects.
 
As you can see, Probina Orion V15 Full is a complete package of professional tools for structural engineering that can help you with your projects from start to finish.
