## What is an ad hoc server?
 
An ad hoc server is a program that simulates a local wireless network for PSP games that support ad hoc mode. Ad hoc mode is a feature that lets PSP users play multiplayer games with nearby devices without using a router or internet connection. However, since PPSSPP is not a real PSP, it cannot use the same wireless technology as the PSP. Therefore, an ad hoc server is needed to create a virtual network that PPSSPP can join.
 
## How to download and run an ad hoc server?
 
There are different versions of ad hoc servers available online, but one of the most popular ones is the one created by Coldbird. You can download it from [this link](https://github.com/coldbird/pspemu-adhocserver). After downloading the file, extract it to a folder of your choice. Then, double-click on the adhocserver.exe file to run it. You should see a black window with some text. This means that the ad hoc server is running and waiting for connections.
 
## How to configure PPSSPP for multiplayer mode?
 
Before you can play multiplayer games on PPSSPP, you need to configure some settings in the emulator. Follow these steps:
 
1. Open PPSSPP and go to Settings > Networking.
2. Enable WLAN (beta) and Enable built-in PRO ad hoc server.
3. In the PRO ad hoc server IP address field, enter the IP address of the computer that is running the ad hoc server. If you are running the ad hoc server on the same computer as PPSSPP, you can enter localhost or 127.0.0.1. If you are running the ad hoc server on a different computer, you need to find out its IP address by using the ipconfig command in Windows or the ifconfig command in Linux.
4. In the Change MAC address field, enter a unique MAC address for each device that will connect to the ad hoc server. A MAC address is a 12-digit hexadecimal number that identifies a network device. You can use any random number as long as it does not match with another device's MAC address.
5. Save your settings and exit PPSSPP.

- Make sure that all devices are using the same version of PPSSPP and the same game ISO file.
- Make sure that all devices have enabled WLAN (beta) and built-in PRO ad hoc server in PPSSPP settings.
- Make sure that all devices have entered the same IP address of the ad hoc server and have different MAC addresses in PPSSPP settings.
